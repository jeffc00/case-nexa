## Presentation

We want you to create a small presentation (use Google Slides) summarizing your findings and answering a few questions. \
However the slides should be self-explanatory, be prepared to present your slides and answer additional questions.

Your findings should focus on any relevant facts about the problem or concerns about the quality of the service provided\
by the clinic.

The questions we want you to answer in your presentation are:
* Is it better to break down the problem into the forecasting of different components? Why?
* What is the relationship between patient temperature and consultation duration?
* Is there a relationship between time of the day and consultation duration? What could likely explain that?
* Apart from the assessment result (_normal_, _urgent_), what is the feature that is more relevant for the problem?
* What is your opinion about the scoring metric implemented in `evaluate.py`? Is there real-world support for it?
* If you had more days to work on the solution, how would you architect the solution?
