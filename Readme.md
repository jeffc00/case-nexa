# Instructions
1. ```model_training.py```:
  * trains a linear model using Ridge Regression
    * model's final features are already predefined, based on previous EDA
  * by default, uses ```summary.csv``` data from days 1 to 45 for training and validation, and days 46 to 50 for model evaluation
  * training the model is very simple: just run ```python3 model_training.py``` on terminal which will generate three ```pickle``` files:
      * ```scaler_stats.pkl```: mean and standard deviation from standardization of fetaures during training
      * ```trained_model_coefs.pkl```: coefficients of the final model
      * ```trained_model_features.pkl```: features of the final model
      
2. ```current_model.py```:
  * contains the current trained linear model which was incorporated in ```your_model.py```
  * it uses the ```pickle``` files generated by ```model_training.py``` to scale the new data e make the predictions
  * as an example, you can run ```python3 evaluate.py eval-data``` and get the average RMSLE on the predictions from these data
